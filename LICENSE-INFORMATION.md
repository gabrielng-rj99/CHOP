# License and Compliance Information

## Project License

Entity Hub Open Project is licensed under the **GNU Affero General Public License v3.0** (AGPL-3.0).

This is a strong copyleft license designed to protect user freedom and ensure that improvements to the software remain available to the community.

## What is AGPL-3.0?

AGPL-3.0 is a free software license based on the GNU GPL v3, with an additional clause specifically addressing network services. Key characteristics:

- **Copyleft**: Derivative works must be licensed under the same terms
- **Network Service Clause**: If you provide this software as a network service (SaaS), you must provide source code access to your users
- **Commercial Use**: You can use this software commercially and charge for services
- **Attribution**: You must give appropriate credit to the original authors

## Your Rights

Under AGPL-3.0, you are free to:

✅ **Use** - Run the software for any purpose  
✅ **Study** - Examine and understand the source code  
✅ **Modify** - Make changes to the code  
✅ **Distribute** - Share copies with others  
✅ **Commercialize** - Offer services based on this software  

## Your Obligations

If you use, modify, or distribute Entity Hub Open Project:

1. **Preserve Notices** - Keep copyright notices and license information intact
2. **Document Changes** - Clearly mark modifications you've made
3. **Disclose Source** - Provide source code to anyone who receives your version
4. **Same License** - Distribute modifications under AGPL-3.0
5. **Network Service** - If offering as a service, make source available to users

## Important: Network Service Clause

The AGPL's most distinctive feature is the "network service" clause (Section 13):

> If you modify the Program, your modified version must prominently display that fact, and if the modified Program is accessed remotely through a computer network, users must have a way to get its source code.

**This means:**
- If you run Entity Hub as a SaaS/web service, you must provide source code access
- You can still charge for the service, support, hosting, etc.
- You cannot withhold the code from users just because they're accessing it over the network

## Business Models Compatible with AGPL-3.0

Entity Hub AGPL-3.0 license allows these business models:

- **SaaS/Hosting** - Charge users for hosted access (but provide source code)
- **Support & Services** - Charge for professional support, custom implementations
- **Professional Services** - Consulting, integration, customization
- **Training & Documentation** - Educational materials and training courses
- **Resale** - Redistribute with modifications (if source is provided)
- **Plugins & Extensions** - Proprietary extensions that interoperate with the core
