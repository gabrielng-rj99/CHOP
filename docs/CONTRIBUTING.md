## Styleguides

### Git Commit Messages

  * `perf`: A code change that improves performance
  * `test`: Adding missing tests or correcting existing tests
  * `build`: Changes that affect the build system or external dependencies
  * `ci`: Changes to our CI configuration files and scripts
  * `chore`: Other changes that don't modify src or test files
